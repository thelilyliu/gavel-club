            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>The Brampton Gavel Club was established on September 8, 2012 and officially became an affiliate of Toastmaster International on November 30, 2012. It was founded by Malcolm Jones with the support of Brampton Speakeasy Toastmasters Club.</p>

            <p>Since its humble beginnings, the Gavel Club has provided youth &mdash; ages 10 to 17 &mdash; a safe and supportive environment to enhance their communication and leadership skills through the use of Toastmasters education material.</p>

            <h3>Where Leaders Are Made</h3>

            <p>The world needs leaders. These leaders must not only accomplish, they must communicate. By regularly giving speeches, gaining feedback, leading teams and guiding others to achieve their goals in a supportive atmosphere, leaders emerge from the Toastmasters program.</p>

            <p>Every Toastmaster's journey begins with a single speech. During their journey, they learn to tell their stories. They listen and answer. They plan and lead. They give feedback &mdash; and accept it. Through our community of learners, they find their path to leadership.</p>
