            <h3>Ryan Belluz</h3>

            <p>Ryan Belluz has been involved with the Brampton Gavel Club since October 2013. His original role was that of Assistant Counsellor under the leadership and mentorship of the founder of the BGC, Malcolm Jones. When Malcolm moved to south-western Ontario in August 2014, Ryan took over the role of lead Counsellor of BGC. At the adult level of Toastmasters, Ryan has been a member of Confidently Speaking Toastmasters in Mississauga (August 2010 to August 2014), where served on the club executive as both Sergeant at Arms (2011-2012) and Vice President of Membership (2012-2013).</p>

              <p>He is currently a member of Schulich Toastmasters at York University, where he recently served as Sergeant at Arms (2015-2016). He has received his Advanced Communicator Bronze and Advanced Leader Bronze designations and is working towards his DTM. Ryan has also advanced all the way to the Division level during the 2013 Toastmasters International Speech Contest.</p>

              <p>Aside from his Toastmasters related activities, Ryan is currently a fourth year student on the Dean's Circle of Student Scholars at York University. He is working towards receiving his Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies (minoring in History) and Bachelor of Education at the intermediate/senior level. His career goal is to one day work with students with disabilities at the secondary school level.</p>

              <p>Ryan has also been a featured speaker on the topic of bullying. Some of the places he has spoken at include: individual classrooms and school assemblies, educational assistant workshops, youth groups, momondays (Guelph, Brampton, and Mississauga), and various other gatherings. He has also been featured on the radio.</p>

              <p>Most importantly, Ryanâ€™s greatest joy in being Counsellor of the BGC is seeing the Gaveliers grow (not just in height) in their communication and leadership skills.</p>
